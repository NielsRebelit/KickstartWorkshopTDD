/// String Calculator
/// ----------------------------------
/// Create a simple calculator that takes a string and returns an integer.
/// 
/// Requirements:
/// 
/// 1. The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum as a result.
///         So the inputs can be: “”, “1”, “1,2”. And for an empty string, it will return 0.
///         
/// 2. Allow the add method to handle an unknown number of arguments.
/// 
/// 3. Allow the add method to handle newlines as separators, instead of commas.
/// 
/// 4. Add validation to not to allow a separator at the end.
/// 
/// 5. Allow the add method to handle different delimiters.
/// 
/// 6. To change the delimiter, the beginning of the input will contain a separate line that looks like this:  
///         //[delimiter]\n[numbers] Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2
///
